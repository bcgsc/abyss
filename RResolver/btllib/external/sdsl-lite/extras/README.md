# Additional resources


## Cheatsheet

A short reference for the use of the library can be generated by executing
`make` in the [cheatsheet](./cheatsheet) directory.


## Debugging

Sometimes even the best coder produces bugs. For this case we provide a
useful resource for the [GNU Debugger][gdb].
Copy the content of `sdsl.gdb` into your .gdbinit file an you can display the
elements of `sdsl::vector<>` (and `sdsl::bitvector`) with the command `pv` in
gdb.

## Code style

The install script will copy the [pre-commit](./pre-commit) file into the
`.git/hooks` directory of your library clone. It will run [astyle][as]
before code gets committed. Please make sure that you have it installed
[astyle][as], if you plan to push your changes to the project.
